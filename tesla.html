        <b>Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Lika, Austrian Empire
        [now in Croatia]—died Jan. 7, 1943, New York, N.Y., U.S.), Serbian U.S.
        inventor and researcher. He studied in Austria and Bohemia and worked in
        Paris before coming to the U.S. in 1884. He worked for Thomas Alva
        Edison and George Westinghouse but preferred independent research. His
        inventions made possible the production and distribution of
        alternating-current electric power. He invented an induction coil that
        is still widely used in radio technology, the Tesla coil (1891); his
        system was used by Westinghouse to light the 1893 World’s Columbian
        Exposition. Tesla established an electric power station at Niagara Falls
        that delivered power to Buffalo, N.Y., by 1896. His research also
        included work on a carbon button lamp and on the power of electrical
        resonance. He discovered terrestrial stationary waves (1899–1900),
        proving that Earth is a conductor. Due to lack of funds, many of his
        ideas remained only in his notebooks, which are still examined by
        enthusiasts for inventive clues.</b
