        <i>Albert Einstein, (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Württemberg, Ger.—died
        April 18, 1955, Princeton, N.J., U.S.), German-born Swiss-U.S.
        scientist. Born to a Jewish family in Germany, he grew up in Munich, and
        in 1894 he moved to Aarau, Switz. He attended a technical school in
        Zürich (graduating in 1900) and during this period renounced his German
        citizenship; stateless for some years, he became a Swiss citizen in
        1901. Einstein became a junior examiner (or clerk) at the Swiss patent
        office in 1902 and began producing original theoretical work that laid
        many of the foundations for 20th-century physics. He received his
        doctorate from the University of Zürich in 1905, the same year he won
        international fame with the publication of four articles: one on
        Brownian motion, which he explained in terms of molecular kinetic
        energy; one on the photoelectric effect, in which he demonstrated the
        particle nature of light; and two on his special theory of relativity,
        the second of which included his formulation of the equivalence of mass
        and energy (E = mc2). Einstein held several professorships before
        becoming director of Berlin’s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in
        1913. In 1915 he published his general theory of relativity, which was
        confirmed experimentally during a solar eclipse in 1919 with
        observations of the deflection of light passing near the Sun. He
        received a Nobel Prize in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect,
        his work on relativity still being controversial. For decades he sought
        to discover the mathematical relationship between electromagnetism and
        gravitation, which he believed would be a first step toward discovering
        the common laws governing the behaviour of everything in the universe,
        but such a unified field theory eluded him. His theories of relativity
        and gravitation represented a profound advance over Newtonian physics
        and revolutionized scientific and philosophical inquiry. He resigned his
        position at the Prussian Academy when Adolf Hitler came to power and
        moved to Princeton, N.J., where he joined the Institute for Advanced
        Study. Though a longtime pacifist, he was instrumental in persuading
        Pres. Franklin Roosevelt in 1939 to initiate the Manhattan Project for
        the production of an atomic bomb, a technology his own theories greatly
        furthered, though he did not work on the project himself. Einstein
        became a U.S. citizen in 1940 but retained his Swiss citizenship. The
        most eminent scientist in the world in the postwar years, he declined an
        offer to become the first prime minister of Israel and became a strong
        advocate for nuclear disarmament.</i
